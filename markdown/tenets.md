What does `Scrum` postulate?

_... and does any of it make sense?_


_Teams self-organize_


Teams self-organize

_if they are stable._

Note: See also
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development
(Bruce Tuckman, 1965). Any time a team changes, it goes right back to
the Forming stage.


_Sprint after sprint after sprint._


Sprint after sprint after sprint.

_Try that in a marathon._


_Daily scrum._

Note: Defined as time-boxed event of 15 minutes involving the entire
development team, answering the following questions:

- What did I do yesterday to help the team achive its sprint goals?
- What am I doing today to help the team achive its sprint goals?
- Is anything blocking holding me (or us) up?

Note: In rugby union, a scrum is a restart of play following a minor
infringement. This is such a potentially dangerous activity that
professional players recognize a safeword, "neck", to be uttered by
any player who fears that his neck is about to break. How anyone could
consider this an acceptable metaphor for a team meeting escapes me.

_No planning beyond the current sprint._

_This only works if you have zero customers._


_Reasonable for emergencies._


Reasonable for emergencies.

_If your team is permanently in an emergency, **quit.**_

Note: Goes both ways: if you're _on_ the team, you're in a bad place
and headed for worse. If you're responsible _for_ the team, you're
doing bad things to your people.


_Waterfall is bad. `Scrum` is novel._


Waterfall is bad. `Scrum` is novel.

_Not since 1975, really._

_If `Scrum` doesn't work with your team, your problem is your team._


If `Scrum` doesn't work with your team, your problem is your team.

Nope. _Your problem is `Scrum`._


_If `Scrum` miserably fails to deliver in your organization, it's

If `Scrum` miserably fails to deliver in your organization, it's

Nope. _This only happens if you're doing it right._


_Don't be a scrumbag._
